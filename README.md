üõ†Ô∏è **Installation**

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Steps

Clone the repository (or download the ZIP):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/husenhu/YT-Downloader-3.0.git
cd YT-Downloader-3.0
```

Install Python dependencies:

```pip install PyQt5 yt-dlp requests```

üöÄ How to Run
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:

```cd YT-Downloader-3.0```

Run the main application script:

```python main.py```

üí° Usage
- Automatic Tool Setup: Upon the first launch, the application will automatically check for, download, and set up yt-dlp and FFmpeg executables in a tools/ subfolder. This process will be displayed in the application's log area and progress bar. Please wait for this to complete.
- Enter URL: Once the tools are ready, paste the YouTube video URL into the "Video URL" input field.
- Select Format: Choose your desired download format from the dropdown menu ("Best (Video & Audio MP4)" or "MP3 (Audio Only)").
- Start Download: Click the "Download" button.
- Monitor Progress: The download progress will be shown in the log area and the progress bar.
- Find Downloads: All downloaded files will be saved in a downloads/ folder created in the same directory as the application.

üåê How it Works
The application uses yt-dlp as the core downloader. yt-dlp is a command-line program that downloads videos from YouTube and many other video sites. FFmpeg is used by yt-dlp for various media manipulation tasks, such as converting video to MP3 or merging audio and video streams.
The Python script dynamically locates yt-dlp and FFmpeg within the tools/ directory. For multi-OS compatibility, it intelligently handles different executable names (e.g., .exe for Windows) and sets appropriate file permissions for Linux/macOS. The download and extraction of these tools are handled in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive.
